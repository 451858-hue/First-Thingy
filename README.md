# Abstracting Real Objects Project-Snake
This Java project simulates a simple Snake object with various behaviors such as slithering, eating, shedding skin, and biting.
It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts including:

Classes & Objects

Constructors (default, overloaded, and parameterized)

Encapsulation with getters and setters

Method overloading & behavior simulation

Interacting objects (Snake and Food)

The App class serves as the entry point and demonstrates how the Snake behaves when various methods are called.
